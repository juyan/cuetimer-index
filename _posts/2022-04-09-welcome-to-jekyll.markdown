Hi there, welcome to CueTimer! I hope the app itself is intuitive enough so you don't need to learn how to use it, but here's a simple overview of the app just in case!

## Simple Timer

The tab on the left is a "simple timer". It's basically same as the iOS's system timer, but with voice reminders! By selecting the time, tapping "enable voice reminder" and tap "Reminde me when..." cell you can choose when should the app remind you about the time left.

## Multistep Timer

Multistep timer allows you to perform a series of timers with a set duration respectively. Tap the plus icon and then choose the name, duration, orders of each step and you are all set! If enabled, voice reminder will play the sound of the name of the step when it starts.
