# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why I'm not getting voice reminder sound?
CueTimer relies on push notification to play the sound for voice reminder. So it is subject to limits of Apple's push notification. Specifically there are three common scenario where this might happen, and fortunately they all have a easy fix!

### Silent mode
Check if your iPhone is in silent mode, if so, turn silent mode off.

### Focus
If your iPhone turned on [Focus](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608), you would need to either turn it off, or whitelist CueTimer app to send notifications. See more on how to do this at Apple's [support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608)

### Apple Watch
If you wear an Apple watch, by default Apple watch will intercept the push notification when the iphone is on lock screen. Due to system limits Apple watch is unable to play voice reminder sounds. So you need to turn off "Mirror iPhone Alerts" settings for CueTimer to let CueTimer notifications always played on the iPhone. You can find how to do that in this [support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204791) by Apple.

## What is the difference between free and premium tier?

You can totally use the CueTimer app for free. However there are some limitations:
- Voice reminder for when five or ten seconds left is unavailable
- You can create at most one mutli-step timer.

By upgrading to Premium tier you are able to get rid of those limitations. I will happily use that money to buy myself a coffee to code better!
